Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum gain increasing importance and almost everyone has heard the terms somewhere. Cryptocurrency system offer the possibility to revolutionize the existing financial systems and create a real value as an traditional currency.

#### Cryptocurrency

A Cryptocurrency is quite simply a digital currency. The word "crypto" refers to the cryptography, the science around the encryption of information. You can make payments with Cryptocurrencies, just like with other currencies. If you want to buy something and the seller accepts those currencies, you can simply transfer the required price to his digital account.

#### What is the difference to traditional currencies, like Euro?

There is no finacial institutes, no third party who manages our account and then transfers the money transfers. At most cryptocurrencies, we are the "bank", computers distributed all around the world, calculate our referrals and maintain a persistent list. This list of past referrals, also referred as blockchain, is the most important innovation in cryptocurrency system.

#### Blockchain

The "blockchain" contains all the transfers ever made, collected in blocks. Once a block is full and once completed, it can never be changed again. This provides the very high security to cryptocurrency transfers.

#### My account

As explained, Cryptocurrencies do not need a finacial institutes, so you do not need to log in or create an account to an institute for their management. This is the reason why many cryptocurrency transfers are also completely anonymous. What you have to do is just create your own account.

If you want to create a new account, you can easily do this with so-called "wallets". A wallet is nothing more than a computer program, which knows how the selected crypto is constructed. When you create an account, two keys are created. One of these keys is the public address that can be passed to receive referrals, similar to a conto number. The second key is secret and may never be passed on. It is the key with which you can send referrals yourself. Similar to the PIN of a bank card. Who owns this private key is also the owner of the account.

If you want to know how much money you have just available, you simply open my wallet. This program then goes through the entire list and computes all past referrals and shows me my result.


#### How is new money generated?

If, for example, Europe wants to produce new Euros, the European Central Bank can set a certain sum and integrate it into the existing financial system without any real equivalent. Even banks have long been no longer with real countervalues. This is different with cryptocurrencies! All money has a direct value, namely the work of a computer. New cryptocurrency units are given to anyone who makes their computer available for calculating new blocks. This process is called "mines".

Thus, a rapid depreciation of money within a cryptocurrency is much less than with the established financial systems and thus guarantees a high stability.
